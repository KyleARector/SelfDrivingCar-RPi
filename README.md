# Self Driving Car
Experimenting with Raspberry Pi 3 and OpenCV as a platform for vehicle autonomy.

I don't expect it to be powerful enough to handle everything, but we will see what it can do.

There will probably be limitations on what can and cannot be controlled in my car, but the desired outcome is the system at least recommends driving action based on sensor activity.

## Features
- Connectivity with in-car display screen
- Streaming from rearview mirror mounted camera

## To Do
- Add GPS module
- Add forward ultrasonic sensor(s)
- Lane detection
- Signage detection
- CAN Interface
